# Dev Resources

This repository is my personal collection of useful developer resources, including command references, helpful links, and library information. It serves as a quick reference for when I need to look up commands, links, or other development-related information.

## Contents

### English
1. [Commands](./en/commands.md) - A list of commonly used commands and their explanations.
2. [Useful Links](./en/useful-links.md) - A curated list of helpful links for various development topics.
3. [Library](./en/library.md) - Information about libraries and frameworks used in my projects.

### ภาษาไทย
1. [Commands](./th/commands.md) - รายการคำสั่งที่ใช้บ่อยและคำอธิบายการใช้งาน.
2. [Useful Links](./th/useful-links.md) - ลิงก์ที่มีประโยชน์สำหรับหัวข้อต่างๆ ในการพัฒนา.
3. [Library](./th/library.md) - ข้อมูลเกี่ยวกับไลบรารีและเฟรมเวิร์กที่ใช้ในโปรเจกต์ของฉัน.

## Purpose

I created this repository to:
- Keep track of useful commands that I might forget
- Store links to helpful resources I've found
- Document information about libraries I use frequently

While this is primarily for my personal use, I've made it public in case others find it helpful. Feel free to browse and use any information you find useful!

## How to Use

- Simply browse through the files to find the information you need.
- You can use GitHub's search feature to quickly find specific commands or topics.
- Star this repository if you find it useful and want to come back to it later.

## Note

This is a personal reference repository, so it's updated based on my own needs and experiences. The information here might not always be complete or up to date, but I try to keep it as accurate as possible for my own use.

If you notice any errors or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue. While I may not always be able to respond or update quickly, I appreciate any feedback that can help improve this resource.
